# Pathfare

Welcome to **Pathfare**! This is a fun and experimental project that started with Firebase's Gemini (Firebase Studio) and evolved into a collaborative effort with ChatGPT to bring it to completion. The project is deployed and live at [https://swiftroute-hbgui.web.app/](https://swiftroute-hbgui.web.app/).

## About the Project

This project began as an exploration of Firebase's Gemini (Firebase Studio) to understand its capabilities. Along the way, ChatGPT was used to brainstorm ideas, debug issues, and finalize the implementation. It has been a fun and educational journey, and the result is a functional and interactive web application.

Enjoy exploring the project!

## How the Code Works

This project leverages Firebase as the backend to handle authentication, database management, and hosting. The frontend is built using modern web technologies to provide a seamless and interactive user experience. Key features include:

- **Firebase Integration**: Real-time database and hosting.
- **Dynamic UI**: Built with responsive design principles.
- **AI Assistance**: ChatGPT was used to refine and complete the project.
