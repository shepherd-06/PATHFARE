# Delivery Calculator App

This project is a front-end implementation for [Wolt Enginnering Summer Intern, 2023](https://github.com/woltapp/engineering-summer-intern-2023). A front-end implementation will be available [here on this Netlify Page](https://snazzy-pasca-f6014b.netlify.app/).

This project can be implemented and tested locally by following the scripts below, nothing changed from the original recipe.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### To Build for Production

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

## Feature List

* Ability to calculate the delivery price based on cart value, delivery distance, total items in the bag and order time.

* Can check for data validation if the input value is wrong.

## Technology Choice

I have used ReactJS as it's one of the easier Javascript framework I have seen. It has good resources and I can easily shift from python to React.
